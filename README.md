# Interactive Navigation Menu

## Task Overview

This project is part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The task involves creating an interactive navigation menu that remains visible on all pages and changes color or style when the user scrolls or hovers over a menu item.

## Features

- **Fixed Position:** The navigation menu is fixed at the top of the page and stays visible as the user scrolls through the content.
- **Scroll Interactivity:** When the user scrolls down the page, the background color or font color of the navigation menu changes.
- **Hover Effect:** Menu items change style (such as background color or font color) when hovered over.
- **Cross-Page Visibility:** The navigation menu is accessible and functional across all pages of the site.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the navigation menu and its items.
- **CSS**: Applied for styling the menu and defining hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: Added interactivity, including the functionality to detect scrolling and change the appearance of the menu.
